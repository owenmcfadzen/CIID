CIID - Introduction to Processing
====

Berechnete Sch√∂nheiten, or Calculated beauty was a course instructed by Dennis P Paul (http://www.d3-is.de) & Jacob Sikker Remin (http://www.jacobsikkerremin.com) where theyintroduced me to programming in February 2013. Although I had had a small amount of experience with front-end development, this was the real stuff now. This week introduced me to some generative design, music and 3D. Things I had never had experience programming before this. The theme of the week was to be idiots, to learn-by-doing and after a highly iterative. 

Another great influence in this project (and through out the year) has been Daniel Shiffman and in particular his vimeo series on The Nature of Code & Computer Programming for the Total Beginers. This, taught with Dennis and Jacob and late night peer-to-peer sessions, became a intensive and insightful week where I was able to develop a my understanding, my appreciation and gave me the chance to pass on a bit of knowledge (the best bit).
