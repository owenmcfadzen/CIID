CIID - Generative Design
====

Moment Obscure was a project for a generative design class taught at CIID. We were given Samsung Tabs and told to go out, use the sensors and built something. What we built was a new look at the camera. A camera is great at taking a picture. When you take that picture the light is captured and you have an image of a location or moment. But reading that image later only reveals just that, an image, a look of some place in a moment of time. We used the camera and the microphone to convey the feeling of location. From the center of the screen come triangular images that move and change according to the locations soundscape. The color of the triangular forms is then dictated by analyzing the underlying photos color.
